## 🔎 Roadmap
**InfoSeek**  is currently under active development, with resources and prototypes continuously being published at this repository.
- [x] Dataset
- [x] Data Construction Codes
- [x] SFT Training Code
- [x] Technical Report
- [ ] RL Training Code
- [ ] InfoSeeker Model

## 🔆 Overview
We propose **InfoSeek**, a scalable data synthesis framework for constructing structurally complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek designs a dual-agent system to recursively build a *Research Tree* by mining entities and relations from large-scale text, and blurring itermediate vertices to ensure they form valid sub-problems. The agent then transform these trees into natural language questions whose solutions require traversing the entire hierarchy. Using InfoSeek pipeline, we construct a high-quality, complexity-controllable, and intrinsically verifiable dataset.

## 📋 InfoSeek Data

We released [InfoSeek dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lk123/InfoSeek) on 🤗

### Example 1:
**Question:** What is a species of bird that was named by a person employed under his father between 1818 and 1824, whose wife was a British artist, and which has three subspecies and body length is generally no more than 6 inches?

**Answer:** Russet sparrow
